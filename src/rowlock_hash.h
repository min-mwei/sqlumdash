** code should not attempt to access or modify the fields of this structure
** directly.  Change this structure only by using the routines below.
** However, some of the "procedures" and "functions" for modifying and
** accessing this structure are really macros, so we can't really make
** this structure opaque.
**
** All elements of the hash table are on a single doubly-linked list.
** Hash.first points to the head of this list.
**
** There are Hash.htsize buckets.  Each bucket points to a spot in
** the global doubly-linked list.  The contents of the bucket are the
** element pointed to plus the next _ht.count-1 elements in the list.
**
** Hash.htsize and Hash.ht may be zero.  In that case lookup is done
** by a linear search of the global list.  For small tables, the 
** Hash.ht table is never allocated because if there are few elements
** in the table, it is faster to do a linear search than to manage
** the hash table.
